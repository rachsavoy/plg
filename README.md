## Primary Function One-Onboarding

The first primary function is to onboard new lawyers and support staff allowing an easy transition into the company. The new employee will have a checklist to complete with forms and trainiing videos to watch. Also, there is a ticketing system that allows the new employee to send requests for help or they can use the messaging system within the app to speak with the administrator.

## Testing

[![Test Count](https://img.shields.io/badge/total%20tests-100-blue)]()
[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-100%25-brightgreen)]()

To run the test suite run:
```
bundle exec rspec
```

To view the coverage report run:
```
open coverage/index.html
```

Testing philosophy is based off off the Classic Approach or Chicago School a.k.a Inside Out TDD.

The levels covered range from unit/models, requests, and features.  It also includes additional coverage along jobs, mailers, presenters, and services.

The primary toolset is managed by rspec; test data is managed by factorybot; coverage is managed by simplecov; cleaning is managed by database_cleaner; and additional services are provided by shoulda-matchers.

The primary web driver is handled by capybara.

If you implement any new features please validate all tests pass prior to pushing your branch.  If you submit a pull request please validate all test pass successfully on the github action workflow.  You should see a green check by the last commit if all tests have passed.

The visual design philosophy for this project was to align the core color schemes of the company with a simple user friendly website. The framework that is being used is bootstrap. 

We've generated a Kitchensink route, controller action, and view to populate with front-end components. Every time you are using a component make sure you use the ones from the kitchen sink (or add them if you are creating new ones).
