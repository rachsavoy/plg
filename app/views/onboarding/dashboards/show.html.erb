				<h1> Our Vision </h1>
				<h6>As I set out to build a new cloud-based law firm, I conducted extensive research, but also drew heavily on my experiences working at a large, successful cloud-based law firm, my time in solo and small firm practice, and my time in the Navy. One thing that I was not inhibited by was the traditional big-law mindset of “this is the way that it’s done” and its associated prejudices. I was focusing on providing service to a different client group and could therefore focus on building the best platform to service those clients, instead of the trappings of the traditional “law firm centric” model.</h6>

				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<h6> Parlatore Law Group was founded on the principle of eliminating all the unnecessary overhead expenses associated with traditional law firms while providing the highest quality legal services.One of the largest financial burdens that traditional law firms carry is the rent and maintenance of large, opulent offices. However, intelligent and innovative use of cloud-based technology makes the need for large physical offices obsolete.</h6>
